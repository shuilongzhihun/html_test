It is noteworthy that rooms with the same prefix are segmented from the same area, and assembling these rooms together can result in a complete area. The point cloud files for each room are stored in the PLY format, using a binary, and contain eight columns of data: &#8216;x&#8217;, &#8216;y&#8217;, &#8216;z&#8217;, &#8216;red&#8217;, &#8216;green&#8217;, &#8216;blue&#8217;, &#8216;sem&#8217;, &#8216;ins&#8217;. The &#8216;xyz&#8217; are 32-bit floating-point numbers, the range of &#8216;rgb&#8217; data is 0-255, and &#8216;sem&#8217; and &#8216;ins&#8217; use uint16. &#8216;sem&#8217; represents the semantic label number corresponding to the point, and &#8216;ins&#8217; represents the instance label number corresponding to the point. It is important to note that for semantic labels of 0 (i.e., points that are not annotated), their &#8216;ins&#8217; label should also be 0, whereas the &#8216;ins&#8217; labels for all non-unannotated points are greater than or equal to 1. In other words, if there are no unannotated points in a scene, the instance numbers start from 1; otherwise, they start from 0.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PCAT<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br>We also provide a point cloud annotation tool named PCAT, which allows for the rapid and convenient annotation of point clouds.
